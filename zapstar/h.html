	<h4>Chapter 1
Zap starts!


Zap goes to the hardware store to buy these things:

1. 10m of carbon fibre flooring
2. 10m of carbon fibre arc
3. 2 pieces of 2m of bullet proof glass
4. Carbon fiber landing gear
5. Top of the line electric super colour boosters
6. ARM cortex-A500000xxx control board
7. 2 64k screens
8. Joystick and buttons
9.core inverter
10. Neural engine

Now that Zap had all the parts it was time to get building!
The firs thing Zap had to do was to make the frame, he got his drill and got to work. Once he was done that he installed the joysticks and buttons. The third step is the core inverter, Zap reached behind him where he put it but it wasn’t there! Zap whipped his head around just in time to see a fat guy holding  his core inverter run into his ship and start to take off. Zap threw a tracking beacon at it and it stuck. Zap now could track him. 
	Later that day, Zap logged into his computer and used his program to figure out where the weird fat guy was going, he was going to Lingostinia!
 Chapter 2
Zap asked his dad if he could borrow his ship to go to Lingostinia, and his dad agreed, so Zap started to walk to the family hangar. As he left the village he saw some strange transparent green things that looked like jello. When one was close, about three meters away, it started to levitate and flew toward Zap! He jumped out of the way, and it flew into the 
wall and exploded. Now Zap, Energy sword and laser blaster in hand, charged at the Evil Blobs and in a matter of seconds they all disintegrated. Zap kept walking toward the hangar.  When he was halfway there an army of 30 blobs came rolling squishing and splurging toward him. Zap waited until 10 of the blobs were around him and he unleashed a mighty spin attack with his sword. Soon ten more started to come close, he put his blaster in rapid fire mode and destroyed them. Finally another spin attack dealt with the last 10.
	 When Zap finally made it to the hangar he went to bed because it was late. The next morning he looked up what the green blobs were, and the database said that they were slimes.



Chapter 3
Zap called his dad to ask him the launching protocol and say bye, then he started to prepare for launch.
When everything was ready he got in the ship and fired up the boosters. He shouted, “3…..2…….1……. BLAST OFF!!!!!!!” The rocket lifted off the ground and gaining speed, he flew toward Lingostinia at hyper velocity. Zap was sooooooo excited because this was the first time that he had flown a space ship by himself. Once he landed on Lingostinia it was late so he went to a hotel and booked a room. When Zap made it to his room he flopped down on the bed and went to sleep. he was exhausted after that flight.
	
	In the morning Zap was having breakfast when he heard a knock at the door. When he opened it, a girl in a white space suit came in and told him that her name was Snowy Brevalle. Zap introduced himself and told her why he was on Lingostinia. When Zap mentioned the fat guy Snowy exclaimed, “I know where he is! He’s on the south pole by the Katchanad* outpost and he stole my favourite incubator!His name is Zonio!” Zap and Snowy decided to help each other their plan was to rent a cruiser and get their stuff back.
	The next day Zap walked to Super Duper rentals and rented a Syncaru 256 EX-TREME cruiser. He met Snowy at the city gate and she jumped in the cruiser. Zap set the course for the Katchanad outpost. 
	While the cruiser drove, Zap Programmed a microchip to make a delta that slows down everything except Zap. When they were about 5km away from Katchanad Zap saw a fort of slimes staring right at them. He said,”Now is the perfect time to test my program! He flew up in the air with his rocket boots and activated his delta, slowing down time for the slimes. In the delta he shot all the slimes, relapsed the delta and flew back. 
	They kept cruising and when arrived they sheaded towards the  south pole. When they got there a lot of slimes came rolling toward them, but their blasters were out of energy. Zap flew over the slimes and got behind them once he was there he drew out is energy sword and, slashed left and right disintegrating all the slimes.
	 They made their way to Zonio’s room but he wasn’t there, and they could not find the stuff. Zap scanned the room and saw Zonio’s ship zoom away out the window. Zap shouted, “I have an idea!” He took out his laptop and hacked Zonio’s ship to go to Earth's orbit. Zap and Snowy made their way back to the city and Zap prepared the ship for Blast off. 

Once the ship was ready he called Snowy to come and get in. After she was in, he got in and fired it up. As they left the atmosphere Snowy gasped, ”I’ve never seen space before, it’s awesome!” Zap agreed and they flew toward Earth. Once they reached orbit, Zap caught up with Zonio’s ship. He pulled up beside him and caught him in a lock beam. While Zap grabbed his gear, he told Snowy to grab some armour, rocket boots, and a blaster. They boarded Zonio’s ship and Zap started to hack open the hatch, while Snowy blasted the slimes swarming toward them. When Zap got the hatch open they jumped in and fought their way to Zonio’s chamber. When they got there Zap’s core inverter and Snowy’s incubator were on the floor but there was not a trace of Zonio. they took their parts to the ship and decreased orbit until they landed in Zap’s back yard. Zap’s dad, ran out wondering what was going on in the backyard and he found Zap shouting,”I GOT MY CORE INVERTER BACK!!!!!!!!!” Zap ran to hug his dad, and saw his mom looking proudly from the window. 
Zap raced to the garage with his core inverter and finished his pod in less than an hour. Snowy congratulated him and he thanked her for her help.
	 That evening Zap showed his friends the interior and took everybody for a ride. Later a satisfied Zap walked to his bedroom and went to bed.
